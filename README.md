7 Background studies 
Job matching systems trace their roots to occupational databases and job placement services. With the evolution of career websites and professional networks, recommender systems now integrate user profiles with job taxonomies using natural language processing and vector similarity measures like cosine similarity. Skills matching, rule filtering, and personalised feedback are key features supported by large-scale datasets from platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and government employment data sources
